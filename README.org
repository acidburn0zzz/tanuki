* Tanuki
  A novelty seeking crawler and link/wait reporting tool for HTML-based
  web applications.

  It is based on the [[https://github.com/kltm/kappa][kappa]] web agent, which is itself based on the wonderful
  [[http://www.weitz.de/drakma/][drakma]].
** Basic usage
*** Local requirements
    Operation of Tanuki assumes access to a Postgres database, a la:
    Assuming good access for user:
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    createdb -h localhost -U tanuki_user -W tanuki
    Access:
    psql -W -U tanuki_user -h localhost tanuki
    #+END_SRC
*** Starting
    A session, starting from scratch.
    #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
    (require :tanuki)
    (in-package :tanuki)
    (defparameter +t+ (make-tanuki-system :start-url "http://localhost/" :data-location "/tmp" :dbname "tanuki" :dbuser "XYZ" :dbpass "ABC" :dbhost "localhost"))
    ;; Build database from scratch, or wipe everything out.
    (initialize-database +t+)
    ;; Start two agents.
    (start-a-tanuki +t+ 'get-aset-weighed)
    (report-general +t+)
    (start-a-tanuki +t+ 'get-distant-aset-random)
    (report-general +t+)
    (stop-tanukis +t+)
    #+END_SRC
*** Continuing
    A session, continuing from last time.
    #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
    (defparameter +t+ (make-tanuki-system :start-url "http://localhost/" :data-location "/tmp" :dbname "tanuki" :dbuser "XYZ" :dbpass "ABC" :dbhost "localhost"))
    ;; Start one agent.
    (start-a-tanuki t1 'get-aset-random)
    (stop-tanukis +t+)
